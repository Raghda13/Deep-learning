Advanced Transformers for Stock Price Prediction
This project demonstrates the application of advanced Transformer architectures to time series prediction. Using synthetic stock price data, I built a Transformer Encoder from scratch and trained it to predict future stock prices. This project helped me understand the inner workings of Transformers, Multi-Head Self-Attention, and model integration in TensorFlow.
