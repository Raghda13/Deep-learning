Advanced Transformers for Stock Price Prediction
This project demonstrates the application of advanced Transformer architectures to time series prediction. Using synthetic stock price data, I built a Transformer Encoder from scratch and trained it to predict future stock prices. This project helped me understand the inner workings of Transformers, Multi-Head Self-Attention, and model integration in TensorFlow.


How to Run
git clone  https://github.com/Raghda13/Deep-learning
cd advanced_transformers.py

2)pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
3)Run the script 
python transformer_stock_prediction.py
