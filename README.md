# Custom Training Loop in Keras
This project demonstrates how to build and train neural networks using custom training loops in TensorFlow and Keras.
It walks through two main parts:
Implementing a manual training loop on the MNIST dataset.
Building a simple binary classification model using standard model.fit() training.

The goal is to understand how Keras models can be trained both manually (step-by-step control) and automatically (using built-in training)
# Enironment
pip install tensorflow numpy

# Dataset
Dataset
MNIST Dataset
https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist
Description: Handwritten digits (0–9) dataset with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images (28×28 grayscale).

# Requirements
TensorFlow
NumPy

# How to Run
1)Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2)Run all cells sequentially.
3)Observe printed loss and accuracy logs per step and epoch
4)Compare manual vs automatic training behaviors.
